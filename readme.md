In the near future, when autonomous vehicles become the norm, RideBuddy allows community members to 
offer rides to senior citizens on weekends when the vehicles are not in use. This would enable
the senior members of the community to visit fun places such as the farmers market and the local library 
without needing to use public transportation.
